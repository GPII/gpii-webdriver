# `gpii.webdriver`

This component wraps a [WebDriver driver](http://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/javascript/module/selenium-webdriver/lib/webdriver_exports_WebDriver.html).
A driver can be used to control a browser installed on the system.  On startup, a webdriver instance is built.  When the
driver is ready, the `onDriverReady` event is fired.

## Component Options

| Option          | Type       | Description |
| --------------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| `browser`       | `{String}` | A lowercase string identifying which [supported browser](http://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/javascript/module/selenium-webdriver/lib/capabilities_exports_Browser.html) to use.  The `SELENIUM_BROWSER` environment variable will always take precedence over this value. Defaults to "firefox". |

## Component Invokers

# `{that}.actions()`

Retrieves an `actions` instance that can be used to perform one or more actions in the current browser.  This value is
passed as the result of `onActionsComplete`.  Returns a promise that is resolved with the same value.

Typically you will use `{that}.actionsHelper` (see below) rather than calling this directly.  If you choose to use this directly,
be aware that you must explicitly call [`perform`](http://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/javascript/module/selenium-webdriver/lib/actions_exports_ActionSequence.html#perform)
to complete your action sequence.

View the WebDriver API documentation for more [details on the underlying `actions` function.](http://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/javascript/module/selenium-webdriver/lib/webdriver_exports_WebDriver.html#actions)

# `{that}.actionsHelper(actionsArray)`

A helper which constructs an entire sequence of actions and executes them in order (including adding the final `perform`
step to indicate that the sequence is complete).  Fires `onActionsHelperComplete` when all actions have been performed.
Returns a promise that is resolved when all actions have been performed.

Each element in `actionsArray` is expected to be keyed by the function name to be executed.  The map values are the
arguments to be passed to the function.  For example:

```
var driver = gpii.webdriver.initSync();
driver.actions([{ sendKeys: [gpii.webdriver.Key.TAB, gpii.webdriver.Key.TAB]}]);
```

The range of supported actions and options can be found in [the WebDriver documentation](http://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/javascript/module/selenium-webdriver/lib/actions_exports_ActionSequence.html).

# `{that}.call(fn, opt_scope, var_args)`

# `{that}.wait(condition, opt_timeout, opt_message)`

Instruct the browser to wait until `condition` is true.  `condition` is typically defined using `gpii.webdriver.until`
(see below).  Fires `onWaitComplete` when the condition has been met, or `onError` if the request times out.  Returns
a promise that will be resolved when the condition is true.  The optional `opt_timeout` parameter represents the number
of milliseconds to wait for `condition` before timing out.  The optional `opt_message` parameter is a custom message
that will be used when rejecting the promise.  This message will appear near the beginning of the `message` element of
[a Javascript `Error`](https://developer.mozilla.org/nl/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error).

Note that Javascript `Error` objects cannot be serialized properly using `JSON.stringify`.  To see the error details,
you'll need to either inspect individual elements (such as `message`), or to call the Error object's `toString` method.
Here are sample sequence steps with a comment regarding the probably value.

```
{
    func: "{testEnvironment}.webdriver.wait",
    args: [gpii.webdriver.until.alertIsPresent(), 500, "Custom message."]
},
{
    listener: "console.log",
    args: ["{arguments}.message"
}
/*

    Outputs something like:

    Error: Custom message.
    Wait timed out after 2264ms

*/
```

Note that the leading text "Error: " and the trailing details are not configurable, and will always appear in the message.

View the WebDriver API documentation for more [details on the underlying `wait` function.](http://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/javascript/module/selenium-webdriver/lib/webdriver_exports_WebDriver.html#wait)

## Error Handling

In addition to the "wrapped" events mentioned above, this component has a unique event (`onError` that is fired
whenever any of the promises created by a "wrapped" function encounter an error.

# `gpii.webdriver.syncInit`

An alternate version of the grade that is built synchronously, and which does not fire an `onDriverReady` event.  This
is meant for use when promises are preferred over the event-driven IoC method.  Note that although the synchronous
version does not fire an event to indicate that it is ready, it does fire all of the other events inherited from the
base grade (see above).

One advantage of this grade is that it can be used almost verbatim with examples from the
[WebDriver documentation](http://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/javascript/index.html).  Here's an example taken
from the WebDriver API that demonstrates using the library directly:

```
var webdriver = require("selenium-webdriver"),
    By = require("selenium-webdriver").By,
    until = require("selenium-webdriver").until;

var driver = new webdriver.Builder()
    .forBrowser("firefox")
    .build();

driver.get("http://www.google.com/ncr");
driver.findElement(By.name("q")).sendKeys("webdriver");
driver.findElement(By.name("btnG")).click();
driver.wait(until.titleIs("webdriver - Google Search"), 1000);
driver.quit();
```

Here's the same example using the `gpii.webdriver.initSync` grade:

```
var driver = gpii.webdriver.initSync({ browser: "firefox"});

driver.get("http://www.google.com/ncr");
driver.findElement(gpii.webdriver.By.name("q")).sendKeys("webdriver");
driver.findElement(gpii.webdriver.By.name("btnG")).click();
driver.wait(gpii.webdriver.until.titleIs("webdriver - Google Search"), 1000);
driver.quit();
```

# `gpii.webdriver.By`

The `By` object provided by the webdriver library is available under this global name.  It is used to construct
selectors for use with invokers like `findElement` (see above).

View the WebDriver API documentation for more [details on the `By` object.](http://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/javascript/module/selenium-webdriver/index_exports_By.html)

# `gpii.webdriver.until`
The `until` object provided by the webdriver library is available under this global name.  It is used to construct
conditions for use with the `wait` invoker (see above).

View the WebDriver API documentation for more [details on the `until` object.](http://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/javascript/module/selenium-webdriver/lib/until.html)

# Key environment variables used by these grades

The underlying WebDriver driver allows you to override two key pieces of information using environment variables:

1. The browser to be used.
2. The external Selenium server to be used (if any).

By default, this grade uses Firefox to run tests (as the driver required is included with our runner).  You can change
this by passing `options.browser` in your component options (see below), or you can set the `SELENIUM_BROWSER`
environment variable to one of [the supported browsers](http://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/javascript/module/selenium-webdriver/lib/capabilities_exports_Browser.html)
(in lowercase form).  Note that this option is not compatible with the use of the [multi-browser harness](allBrowsers.md),
if you are using that, you should use the `BROWSERS` option instead.

By default, this package will work without a Selenium instance.  If you have your own Selenium server, you can use it
by setting the `SELENIUM_REMOTE_URL` environment variable to the URL of your server.

# 404 and other errors

The WebDriver API [does not provide any mechanism to trap HTTP response codes or errors[(https://github.com/seleniumhq/selenium-google-code-issue-archive/issues/141),
for example that result when trying to open a page that doesn't exist.  However, it also does not interfere with the
browser's continued operation following an error.  So, you can (for example) confirm that your site provides an
error message when a page isn't found, but you couldn't confirm that it sends the correct status code.
